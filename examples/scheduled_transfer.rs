    // A scheduled transaction is a transaction that has been proposed by an account,
    // but which requires more signatures before it will actually execute on the Hiero network.
    //
    // For example, if Alice wants to transfer an amount of Hbar to Bob, and Bob has
    // receiverSignatureRequired set to true, then that transaction must be signed by
    // both Alice and Bob before the transaction will be executed.
    //
    // To solve this problem, Alice can propose the transaction by creating a scheduled
    // transaction on the Hiero network which, if executed, would transfer Hbar from
    // Alice to Bob.  That scheduled transaction will have a ScheduleId by which we can
    // refer to that scheduled transaction.  Alice can communicate the ScheduleId to Bob, and
    // then Bob can use a ScheduleSignTransaction to sign that scheduled transaction.
    //
    // Bob has a 30 minute window in which to sign the scheduled transaction, starting at the
    // moment that Alice creates the scheduled transaction.  If a scheduled transaction
    // is not signed by all of the necessary signatories within the 30 minute window,
    // that scheduled transaction will expire, and will not be executed.
    //
    // Once a scheduled transaction has all of the signatures necessary to execute, it will
    // be executed on the Hiero network automatically.  If you create a scheduled transaction
    // on the Hiero network, but that transaction only requires your signature in order to
    // execute and no one else's, that scheduled transaction will be automatically
    // executed immediately.
