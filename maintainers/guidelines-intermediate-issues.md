# Intermediate Issue Guidelines — Hiero Rust SDK

## How to Use This Document

This guide is here to support maintainers and issue creators who use the **Intermediate** label.

It offers shared language, examples, and guidance to help:

**Issue creators:**
- Understand what kinds of tasks usually fit this level  
- Describe goals clearly while leaving room for implementation choices  
- Set contributors up for success with the right amount of context  

**Maintainers:**
- Apply the Intermediate label consistently  
- Keep issue difficulty labels clear and helpful  

This isn’t a rulebook, and it’s not meant to limit what kinds of contributions are welcome.  
All contributions — simple or complex — are valuable to the Hiero project.

The Intermediate label highlights tasks that encourage deeper problem-solving and technical ownership.

---

## Purpose

Intermediate Issues are a great fit for contributors who are ready to **own a solution end-to-end**.

These issues often involve:

- Investigating existing behavior  
- Reasoning about trade-offs  
- Choosing between multiple valid implementation approaches  

At this level, contributors begin to take ownership of technical decisions — not just follow step-by-step instructions.

---

## What to Expect

Intermediate Issues are designed for contributors who:

- Have solid Rust experience  
- Understand the Hiero SDK architecture at a high level  
- Can navigate and update multiple related modules  
- Feel comfortable explaining their implementation choices in a pull request  
- Are open to feedback and discussion during review  

They don’t require authority over system-wide design or deep protocol expertise — just thoughtful problem-solving within clearly defined goals.

---

## How Intermediate Issues Usually Feel

Intermediate Issues often:

- Aren’t fully scripted  
- Involve investigation and understanding of existing behavior  
- Span multiple related files or components  
- Leave room for contributor judgment  
- Encourage discussion about approach, not just correctness  
- Have more than one reasonable solution  

**Helpful rule of thumb:**  
If the task involves exploring the codebase, weighing trade-offs, and choosing an approach, it’s probably a good fit for an Intermediate Issue.

## Common Types of Intermediate Work

Here are some examples of tasks that often work well at this level:

### Good Fits
- Implementing new SDK features with clearly defined goals  
- Refactoring code for maintainability or clarity  
- Localized performance improvements with a stated intent  
- Adding new transaction or query types using existing patterns  
- Improving async or concurrency behavior (e.g., Tokio task management) with guidance  

### Less Ideal Fits
Some tasks are better suited for broader or more exploratory efforts, such as:

- Large-scale or cross-SDK redesigns  
- Introducing entirely new subsystems or frameworks  
- Open-ended work without defined goals  

These contributions are still valuable — they just fit better under different labels.

---

## Typical Scope & Time

Intermediate Issues are usually:

- ⏱ **Estimated time:** 1–3 days  
- 📄 **Scope:** Multiple related files or modules  
- 🧠 **Challenge level:** Investigation, trade-offs, and solution ownership  

If an issue seems likely to grow into a large redesign or extended design discussion, it may be a better fit for a different category.

## Example: A Well-Formed Intermediate Issue

### Consolidate string handling in selected SDK APIs

Some transaction setter methods in the Hiero Rust SDK accept  
`String` parameters that are immediately cloned.

In these cases, accepting `impl Into<String>` can improve API ergonomics and reduce unnecessary allocations.

This issue focuses on **updating a small, specific set of setters** to improve API consistency and reduce unnecessary string clones.

**Suggested approach:**

1. Start with these transaction data types:
   - `FileUpdateTransactionData`  
   - `AccountUpdateTransactionData`  

2. Look for setter methods that:
   - Accept `String` parameters  
   - Clone the value into an internal field  

3. Update those setters to accept:
   - `impl Into<String>` instead, converting at the call site  

4. Adjust the corresponding implementations in `src/file/` and `src/account/` as needed.

5. Make sure all existing tests pass and behavior remains unchanged.

## Why This Is an Intermediate Issue

This task involves:

- Exploring existing patterns across multiple files  
- Reasoning about string handling and validation  
- Weighing API consistency and safety  
- Choosing an implementation approach and explaining it in review  

It doesn’t require architectural redesign or protocol-level changes — just thoughtful, well-scoped technical decisions.

---

## Support & Collaboration

Intermediate Issues are supported through:

- Community discussion in issues and PRs  
- Maintainer feedback during review  

Support is focused on:

- Clarifying goals  
- Discussing trade-offs  
- Reviewing implementation choices  

The aim is to help contributors grow their confidence and technical ownership.

---

## Maintainer Guidance

An issue is often a good fit for the **Intermediate** label when it:

- Encourages investigation and reasoning  
- Has multiple reasonable implementation paths  
- Involves ownership of design decisions within defined goals  
- Can be reviewed in a single pull request  
- Doesn’t introduce new subsystems or major architectural changes  

---

Intermediate Issues are about taking the next step —  
building confidence through deeper problem-solving, with support along the way.
